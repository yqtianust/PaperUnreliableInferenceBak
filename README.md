# Supplementary Materials of Paper: Will DNN-based Image Classification Model Make Unreliable Inferences? #

This page hosts the Supplementary Materials of Paper:  ** Will DNN-based Image Classification Model Make Unreliable Inferences?**

**We are constructing this website and uploading as much data and source code as we have**

The implementation of our approach is not hard. 
We upload our implementation for your reference.

Let us know if you have any questions.

The experiments data is relative large and we are looking for some place to host them.
Let us know if anything you want but has not appear in this website. 
We will try to do it first or share a copy with you somehow.


The supplementary data for our first submission was previously in the folder ``csv_file``.
It is only for archive. Please do not use it any more.
